# The adorables

This is an showcase app demonstanting a few of the current best practices for Android development.

### Experimentation

Instread of using a ViewPager with Fragments I decided to use the new PagerSnapHelper in conjuction with a RecyclerView. This allows to avoid the horrid Fragment APIs. RecyclerView comes with efficent view recyclying, built in animation and better APIs to add/remove/move cells, or in this case 'Pages'.
